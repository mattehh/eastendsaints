            Playoffs
            <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha">
                <li>Playoffs are a three game round robin format. The best regular season team record plays the weakest regular
                    season team record, the second best regular season record team plays the second weakest regular season

                <li>If a playoff championship game is tied at the end of regulation, there will be a 5:00 run-time sudden death
                    period. If there is still a tie after the 5:00 sudden death period, there will be a shootout. The shootout
                    will consist of three shooters for each team. If the score is tied after each teamâ€™s three shooters have
                    shot, the shootout will become a sudden death shootout. Each player on the team must shoot before a player
                    can shoot a second time.

            Miscellaneous rules
            <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha">
                <li>Face-offs are dropped in each end or at centre (a five dot system)</li>
                <li>Games with over a six goal differential will be capped at a six goal differential. As an example, a 12-1
                    game will be logged as a 7-1 final. However, all points scored on the 12 goals will count towards individual
                    player stats.

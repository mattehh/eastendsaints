                    period. If there is still a tie after the 5:00 sudden death period, there will be a shootout. The shootout
                    will consist of three shooters for each team. If the score is tied after each teamâ€™s three shooters have
                    shot, the shootout will become a sudden death shootout. Each player on the team must shoot before a player
                    can shoot a second time.

                    game will be logged as a 7-1 final. However, all points scored on the 12 goals will count towards individual

                <p>Our Senior division is our 18+ division that contains players that played house league through rep ice hockey
                    growing up. It is considered a faster pace out of the two divisions.</p>
                <p>Our Masters Double-X division is competitive but a slower pace than our Senior division. The Masters Double-X
                    division contains players from the age of 14 to over 50, both men and women. If you are new to hockey
                    or roller hockey, this would be a great division to try. This division is also a great division for fathers
                    to play with their sons and/or daughters.</p>
